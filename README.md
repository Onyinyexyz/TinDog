# TinDog
This repository is a project built around the idea of having a dating site for dogs where dog owners could go to choose mates for their dogs. The website works like Tinder, only that in this case it is for dogs and not humans. The project is a task from Angela Yu's Web Development Course on Udemy.

The project is built with HTML, CSS, and Bootsrap.
